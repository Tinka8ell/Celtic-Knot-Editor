# Celtic-Knot-Editor
A simple editor using KnotZoo font to create and manipulate Celtic Knots.
This project is written in python as an aid to creating simple Celtic knots and trying out ideas.
It is using the KnotZoo font developed by Ben Griffin (https://github.com/MrBenGriffin).
I hope to link to his knot generator (https://github.com/MrBenGriffin/Knot) as a way of seading a knot.
