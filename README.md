# Celtic-Knot-Editor
An editor using KnotZoo font to create and manipulate Celtic Knot patterns.
This project is written in python as an aid to creating simple Celtic knots and trying out ideas.
It is using the KnotZoo font developed by Ben Griffin (https://github.com/MrBenGriffin).
I hope to link to his knot generator [Knotwork](https://github.com/MrBenGriffin/Knot) as a way of seading a knot.
I further hope to develope the font to support "removed" ligature to generate single line borders.

## The font
You will need the font 'KNOTS Zoo' installed with ligatures set for this to show what it is doing.
